# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
F-15

## Critical Issues
- **Accessibility**: The need for large-text options is crucial for F-15, yet the current interface may not fully support this requirement, leading to potential usability challenges.
- **Income Constraints**: With a family support income of less than $5k, affordability of healthy ingredients, such as olive oil, is a significant concern.

## Minor Friction
- **Wait Times**: The user experienced a delay (1000 ms) during interactions, which could lead to frustration, especially when searching for specific recipes or products.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Enhanced Accessibility Features**: Implement larger text options and high-contrast themes to improve readability for users with diverse needs.
2. **Budget-Friendly Options**: Curate a selection of affordable Mediterranean recipes and ingredients, highlighting cost-effective alternatives to premium products.
3. **Optimize Load Times**: Reduce wait times by optimizing the website's performance, ensuring a smoother and more efficient user experience. 

By addressing these issues, the platform can better serve F-15 and similar users, promoting healthier eating habits within their financial constraints.
