# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
F-13

## Critical Issues
1. **Accessibility Features**: The current interface lacks comprehensive support for color-blind users, which may hinder navigation and usability.
2. **Dietary Options**: Limited availability of whole-food wings that align with the paleo diet, making it difficult for the user to achieve their dietary goals.

## Minor Friction
1. **Loading Times**: The user experienced a 1-second wait time, which, while not excessive, can still disrupt the overall experience and lead to frustration.
2. **Navigation Clarity**: The interface could benefit from clearer labeling and organization, especially for users with specific dietary needs.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Enhance Accessibility**: Implement more robust color-blind modes and ensure all visual elements are easily distinguishable for users with color vision deficiencies.
2. **Expand Menu Options**: Introduce a wider range of paleo-friendly dishes, particularly whole-food wings, to cater to dietary preferences.
3. **Optimize Performance**: Reduce loading times and improve overall site responsiveness to enhance user satisfaction.
