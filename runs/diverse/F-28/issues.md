# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
F-28

## Critical Issues
1. **Allergen Information Accessibility**: The user has a nut allergy and requires clear allergen pop-ups. If these are not easily accessible or visible, it poses a significant health risk.
2. **Hearing Accessibility**: The user relies on a hearing aid, which may affect their ability to receive auditory alerts or notifications regarding allergens.

## Minor Friction
1. **Loading Times**: The user experienced a 1-second wait, which could lead to frustration, especially when seeking critical allergen information.
2. **Visual Clarity**: If allergen pop-ups are not visually distinct or easy to read, it may hinder the userâ€™s ability to quickly assess safety.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Enhanced Allergen Alerts**: Implement prominent, easily readable allergen pop-ups that are accessible for users with visual impairments.
2. **Reduce Loading Times**: Optimize website performance to minimize wait times, ensuring users can quickly access vital information.
3. **Visual and Auditory Cues**: Provide both visual alerts and optional auditory notifications for allergen warnings to accommodate users with hearing aids.
