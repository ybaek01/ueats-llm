# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
F-24

## Critical Issues
- **Accessibility Challenges**: The user relies on a screen magnifier, which may not be fully compatible with the mobile ordering interface, leading to potential navigation difficulties.
- **First-Time Experience**: As this is the user's first mobile order, a lack of guidance or onboarding can lead to confusion and frustration.

## Minor Friction
- **Loading Times**: The user experienced a 1-second wait, which, while not excessive, can still contribute to a perception of sluggishness, especially for a first-time user.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Enhanced Accessibility Features**: Implement larger buttons and clearer text to accommodate screen magnifier users, ensuring a smoother navigation experience.
2. **Onboarding Tutorial**: Introduce a brief, interactive tutorial for first-time users to guide them through the mobile ordering process, highlighting key features and functionalities.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce loading times and ensure a seamless experience to enhance user satisfaction and retention. 

By addressing these issues, the overall user experience can be significantly improved for F-24 and similar users.
