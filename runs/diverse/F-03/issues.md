### Critical Issues
1. **Allergen Information Accessibility**: Difficulty in finding clear allergen labels on sauces, which is crucial due to nut allergies.
2. **Color Blindness Compatibility**: Current website/app design may not adequately support color-blind users, making it hard to distinguish important information.

### Minor Friction
1. **Loading Times**: A noticeable delay (1 second) when accessing allergen information can lead to frustration, especially in urgent situations.
2. **Navigation Complexity**: The process to locate allergen labels is not intuitive, requiring multiple clicks.

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Enhanced Labeling**: Implement clear, standardized allergen labels on all sauce products, ensuring they are easily visible and understandable.
2. **Color Blind Mode Optimization**: Improve the color contrast and use patterns or symbols alongside colors to aid color-blind users.
3. **Streamlined Navigation**: Simplify the user interface to allow quicker access to allergen information, reducing the number of clicks needed. 

By addressing these issues, the user experience can be significantly improved for individuals with dietary restrictions.
