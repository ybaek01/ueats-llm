# User Experience Report

### Persona Name
F-21

### Critical Issues
1. **Dietary Restrictions**: The user has a corn allergy, which necessitates clear labeling and options for corn-free products. Lack of transparency in ingredient lists can pose serious health risks.
2. **Accessibility Features**: The absence of a color-blind mode in the interface may hinder navigation and product selection, impacting the overall user experience.

### Minor Friction
1. **Loading Times**: The user experienced a 1-second wait time, which, while not excessive, can still contribute to frustration during the sauce testing process.
2. **Navigation Complexity**: The interface may not be intuitive for users with specific dietary needs, making it harder to find suitable products quickly.

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Enhanced Ingredient Transparency**: Implement clear, easy-to-read labels that highlight allergens, particularly for users with dietary restrictions.
2. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Introduce a color-blind mode to improve navigation and product selection for users with visual impairments.
3. **Optimize Loading Times**: Streamline the website or app to reduce wait times and improve overall responsiveness.
