  "analysis": "# Persona Report\n\n**Persona Name:** D-24\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n- Limited access to gout-friendly food options, particularly wings, which are often high in purines.\n- Financial constraints due to a low income bracket (graduate stipend of $14k), making it difficult to afford specialized dietary options.\n\n**Minor Friction:**\n- Lack of awareness or availability of low-purine alternatives in local restaurants or grocery stores in Buffalo, NY.\n- Potential social pressure when dining out with friends who may not understand dietary restrictions.\n\n**Suggested Improvements:**\n- Collaborate with local restaurants to create and promote a menu of gout-friendly wings, highlighting low-purine ingredients.\n- Develop a community resource or app that lists local stores and restaurants offering low-purine options, along with recipes and meal prep tips.\n- Offer educational workshops or online resources to raise awareness about gout-friendly diets, targeting both consumers and food service providers."
