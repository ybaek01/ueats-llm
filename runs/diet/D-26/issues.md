# Persona Report

**Persona Name:** D-26

## Critical Issues
1. **Limited Accessibility:** The persona has no access to resources or facilities that support their dietary needs, making it challenging to find suitable food options.
2. **Dietary Restrictions:** Following a low-fat diet can limit choices, especially when seeking specific items like reduced-fat wings, which may not be readily available.

## Minor Friction
1. **Waiting Time:** The persona experiences delays (e.g., a 1000 ms wait) when searching for food options, which can lead to frustration and a poor user experience.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Enhanced Accessibility:** Partner with local restaurants or grocery stores to provide a dedicated section for low-fat options, including reduced-fat wings.
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** Optimize the search functionality to minimize wait times and improve the overall experience when looking for dietary-specific food options.
3. **Community Support:** Create a platform or forum where individuals with similar dietary goals can share resources, recipes, and recommendations for low-fat meals.
