## Critical Issues
1. **Limited Vegan Options**: The local restaurant may not have a diverse vegan menu, making it difficult for D-01 to find suitable choices.
2. **Accessibility**: D-01 has no accessibility features, which could hinder the ordering process, especially if the restaurant's website or app is not user-friendly.
