### Persona Name
D-04

### Critical Issues
- **Limited Accessibility**: The persona has no accessibility options, which may hinder their ability to order food easily, especially if they have mobility challenges or dietary restrictions.
- **Dietary Restrictions**: The need for kosher food limits the available options, making it difficult to find suitable restaurants in Alexandria.

### Minor Friction
- **Ordering Process**: The persona may experience delays or complications when trying to navigate restaurant menus or online ordering systems that do not clearly indicate kosher options.

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Enhanced Accessibility Features**: Implement user-friendly interfaces for ordering, including voice commands or simplified navigation for those with mobility issues.
2. **Clear Dietary Labels**: Restaurants should provide clear labeling of kosher options on their menus and online platforms to facilitate easier decision-making for customers with dietary restrictions.
