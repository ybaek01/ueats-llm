  "analysis": "# Persona Report\n\n**Persona Name:** D-02\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n- Limited access to gluten-free snacks that are convenient for studying.\n- Financial constraints due to reliance on financial aid, making it difficult to purchase specialty items.\n\n**Minor Friction:**\n- Lack of local stores or online options that cater specifically to gluten-free diets.\n- Difficulty in finding quick, healthy snack options that fit within a student budget.\n\n**Suggested Improvements:**\n- Partner with local grocery stores to create a dedicated gluten-free section that includes affordable snack options.\n- Develop a subscription service for gluten-free snacks tailored for students, offering discounts for those on financial aid.\n- Increase awareness of gluten-free options available on campus or through local delivery services to enhance accessibility for students like D-02. \n\nBy addressing these issues, we can significantly improve the study experience for gluten-free students."
