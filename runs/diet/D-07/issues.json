  "analysis": "# Persona Report\n\n**Persona Name:** D-07\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n- Limited income as a library aide (~$650/mo) may restrict options for higher-priced sushi delivery.\n- Difficulty in finding pescatarian-specific sushi options in Raleigh, NC, which could lead to frustration during the ordering process.\n\n**Minor Friction:**\n- Potential delays in delivery times, which can be exacerbated by high demand or limited restaurant availability.\n- Lack of clear dietary filters on delivery platforms, making it challenging to identify suitable options quickly.\n\n**Suggested Improvements:**\n- Enhance delivery platforms to include a dedicated pescatarian filter, allowing users to easily find relevant sushi options.\n- Partner with local sushi restaurants to offer exclusive pescatarian rolls at a budget-friendly price point for users with lower incomes.\n- Implement a loyalty program or discounts for frequent users to encourage repeat orders and alleviate financial constraints. \n\nBy addressing these issues, the overall experience for D-07 can be significantly improved, making it easier to achieve their goal of ordering a pescatarian sushi roll."
