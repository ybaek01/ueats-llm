# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
**U-29**

## Critical Issues
- **Limited Budget**: As an intern with a stipend of $9,000, U-29 may struggle to afford dining options, especially if wings are priced above budget-friendly options.
- **Accessibility**: No specific accessibility features noted, which could hinder the experience for users with mobility or other challenges.

## Minor Friction
- **Wait Time**: A wait time of 1 second was recorded, which may indicate a need for faster service or a more efficient ordering process.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Budget-Friendly Options**: Introduce special deals or discounts for students and interns to make dining more affordable.
2. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Implement features such as curbside pickup or delivery options to cater to users with mobility issues.
3. **Streamlined Ordering**: Optimize the ordering system to reduce wait times, possibly through a mobile app or pre-ordering feature for study groups. 

By addressing these issues, U-29's experience can be significantly improved, making it easier to achieve their goal of grabbing wings for their study group.
