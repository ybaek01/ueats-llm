# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
**U-17**

## Critical Issues
- **Long Wait Times**: The user experienced a significant wait time (1000 ms) which may indicate inefficiencies in the ordering process, especially when trying to grab wings for a game night.

## Minor Friction

## Suggested Improvements
