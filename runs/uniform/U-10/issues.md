# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
**U-10**

## Critical Issues
- **Financial Constraints**: As a financial aid-only student, U-10 may struggle to afford group meals, limiting social interactions and project collaboration.
- **Accessibility**: Lack of accessibility options can hinder participation in group meals, especially for those with specific needs.

## Minor Friction
- **Waiting Time**: U-10 experienced a delay (1000 ms) which may indicate inefficiencies in the meal ordering or preparation process, potentially leading to frustration.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Subsidized Meal Options**: Introduce affordable meal plans or subsidies for students on financial aid to encourage participation in group meals.
2. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Ensure that dining facilities are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities, to foster an inclusive environment.
3. **Streamlined Ordering Process**: Optimize the meal ordering system to reduce wait times, enhancing the overall dining experience and encouraging group gatherings. 

By addressing these issues, U-10's experience can be significantly improved, promoting social engagement and collaboration.
