# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
U-30

## Critical Issues
- **Time Constraints**: U-30 is a student with limited time due to upcoming exams, making quick meal options essential.
- **Accessibility**: Lack of dietary options and accessibility features may hinder U-30's ability to find suitable meals quickly.

## Minor Friction
- **Waiting Time**: A 1-second wait time, while minimal, can feel longer when under pressure, especially before an exam.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Streamlined Menu Options**: Introduce a dedicated section for quick meals that can be prepared or ordered in under 10 minutes.
2. **Accessibility Features**: Implement filters for dietary preferences and accessibility options to enhance the user experience.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Reduce wait times by providing real-time updates on meal availability and preparation status to alleviate anxiety during busy periods. 

By addressing these issues, U-30 can have a more efficient and satisfying meal experience before exams.
