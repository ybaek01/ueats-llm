# Persona Report

**Persona Name:** U-07

**Critical Issues:**
- **Lack of Food Options:** During the hackathon, U-07 struggles to find suitable lunch options that cater to their dietary needs.
- **Accessibility Concerns:** No clear information on accessibility for food locations, which may hinder U-07's ability to obtain lunch efficiently.

**Minor Friction:**
- **Waiting Time:** U-07 experienced a 1-second wait, which, while minor, can be frustrating in a time-sensitive environment like a hackathon.

**Suggested Improvements:**
1. **Diverse Food Options:** Provide a variety of lunch options that cater to different dietary preferences, ensuring inclusivity for all participants.
2. **Accessibility Information:** Clearly display accessibility features for food locations to assist participants in navigating the venue.
3. **Streamlined Ordering Process:** Implement a pre-order system to minimize wait times and enhance the overall experience during the event.

By addressing these issues, the hackathon can create a more inclusive and efficient environment for all participants.
