# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
U-14

## Critical Issues
- **Limited Dining Options**: The persona, a 19-year-old on a scholarship stipend, may struggle to find affordable and diverse lunch options on campus.
- **Accessibility Concerns**: The lack of specified accessibility features could hinder the experience for students with mobility challenges.

## Minor Friction
- **Waiting Time**: The persona experienced a 1-second wait, which, while minor, could contribute to frustration during peak lunch hours.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Enhance Dining Variety**: Introduce more budget-friendly meal options that cater to diverse dietary preferences, ensuring all students can enjoy lunch on the campus lawn.
2. **Improve Accessibility**: Implement features such as ramps and designated seating areas to accommodate all students, promoting inclusivity.
3. **Streamline Service**: Reduce wait times by optimizing food service processes, possibly through mobile ordering or additional staff during peak hours. 

By addressing these issues, the campus dining experience can be significantly improved for U-14 and similar personas.
