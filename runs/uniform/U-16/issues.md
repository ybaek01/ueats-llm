# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
**U-16**  
Age: 22  
Location: Columbia, SC  
Income Bracket: Financial Aid Only  
Goal: Fuel up for all-nighter  

## Critical Issues
- **Limited Food Options**: As a student relying on financial aid, U-16 may struggle to find affordable, nutritious food options that are available late at night.
- **Accessibility**: Lack of accessible food services during late hours can hinder U-16's ability to meet their goal of fueling up for an all-nighter.

## Minor Friction
- **Waiting Time**: U-16 experienced a 1-second wait, which, while minor, can be frustrating during late-night hours when time is of the essence.

## Suggested Improvements
- **Extended Hours for Food Services**: Implement late-night dining options that cater to students on a budget, ensuring they have access to healthy meals.
- **Mobile Ordering System**: Introduce a mobile app for pre-ordering food to minimize wait times and streamline the process, especially during peak hours.
