# Persona Report

**Persona Name:** U-05

**Critical Issues:**
- Limited income (~$650/month) may restrict U-05's ability to order a large pizza, especially if delivery fees or tips are considered.
- Lack of dietary restrictions could lead to confusion in selecting the right pizza options, especially if there are promotions or deals that don't align with their preferences.

**Minor Friction:**
- The waiting time of 1 second before taking action may indicate a lack of urgency or clarity in the ordering process, potentially leading to frustration.
- The absence of accessibility features could hinder the ordering experience for users with specific needs.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Introduce budget-friendly pizza options or discounts for low-income customers to make ordering more feasible.

- Implement accessibility features, such as voice commands or larger text options, to enhance the user experience for all customers.
