# User Experience Report

## Persona Name
**U-02**  
- Age: 20  
- Location: Providence, RI  
- Income: Part-time job ($4k)  
- Goal: Late-night snack while coding  

## Critical Issues
1. **Accessibility**: The persona has no specific dietary restrictions, but the lack of options for late-night snacks may hinder their ability to find suitable food quickly.
2. **Time Constraints**: As a student with a part-time job, U-02 may have limited time to prepare or order food, especially during late-night coding sessions.

## Minor Friction
- **Waiting Time**: The persona experiences delays when trying to access food options, which can disrupt their workflow and focus during coding sessions.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Curated Late-Night Snack Options**: Develop a platform or app that offers quick, easy-to-order late-night snacks tailored for students and young professionals.
2. **Streamlined Ordering Process**: Implement features that reduce waiting times, such as pre-ordering or express delivery options, to enhance the user experience during late-night hours.
